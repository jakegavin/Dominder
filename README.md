# Dominder

A not-random Dominion set builder.


There are a lot of random set generators for [Dominion](http://riograndegames.com/Game/278-Dominion) but they rarely generate balanced sets. Dominder takes a different approach, showing you cards in a random order and letting you decide if they'd fit in with the set you're generating. Cards are presented in a Tinder-esque way. Swipe right to add to your set or left to move on to the next card.


Dominder uses [Exponent](https://getexponent.com/). To get up and running, clone the repo, open Exponent, and select "Open Project" under the project menu. Exponent allows you to quickly run the app in the iOS or Android simulator without having to mess with Xcode or Android studio. You can also download Exponent app from the app store of your choice and easily load the app onto your native device.


`console.log` is slow. If you're running into performance issues, disable the redux-logger middleware.

- [@brentvatne](https://github.com/brentvatne) - The card interface draws heavily from his [react-native-animated-demo-tinder](https://github.com/brentvatne/react-native-animated-demo-tinder)
- ketura on Reddit - Card data comes from their [spreadsheet of Dominon cards](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominion/comments/3hnz3r/card_spreadsheet/)
